\chapter*{Abstract}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}During the thesis project a webbased library was developed to be used forcreating board and card games that can be played peer-to-peer in a modernwebbrowser without needing the installation of plugins. The library is focussedon the domain's abstraction designed to have the connection and communicationmanagement between the peers as transparent as possible while avoiding thepossibility of cheating without needing a trusted third party for supervision orgenerating randomness.The requirements and risks for such a library were evaluated and the library wasimplemented in JavaScript and WebRTC, together with three exampleimplementations. This document describes the technical decisions, the library'susage and its inner mechanics to achieve the goals. The main points of researchwere: 1) how to design a well usable API without restricting on which of thevarious forms of board games are possible to implement, 2) how tocryptographically assure that manipulating dice and card decks is impossiblewithout needing a trusted server for randomness generation or informationconcealing, and 3) what the status of needed technologies in current webbrowsersis and how they can be used in a way not concerning the library's user incorrespondance with technical implementation limitations.

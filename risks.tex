\chapter{Project Risks}

This chapter describes the perceived risks to the success of the project. The
probabilities were evaluated at the beginning of the project and where avoided
or mitigated during the project as planned.

\section{Microsoft Edge Does Not Support Data Channels Until End of Project}
\label{sec:riskedgedatachannels}

\begin{description}
  \item[Description:] Microsoft Edge currently is on the list of web browsers
  that must be supported (see requirement \ref{itm:supportedbrowsers} in
  section \see{sec:nonfunctionalreq}). Microsoft Edge currently does not support
  a required API (RPCDataChannels) to fulfill the other requirements
  \cite{Microsoft2016datachannels}. This “must” requirement cannot be fulfilled
  if Edge does not support this API as there is currently no way to support
  Edge without depending on a central server for communication.
  \item[Probability:] High (as the implementation priority for Edge is
  currently set to ``low'' \cite{Microsoft2016datachannels})
  \item[Impact:] High (as the project requirements cannot be fulfilled)
  \item[Magnitude:] High
  \item[Response Strategy:] Avoid---The requirement to support Edge is dropped
  from requirement \ref{itm:supportedbrowsers} in section
  \see{sec:nonfunctionalreq}.
\end{description}

\section{The Cryptographical Requirements Are Too Hard to Implement}

\begin{description}
  \item[Description:] Cryptographic requirements such as \ref{itm:mentalpoker}
  in section \see{sec:nonfunctionalreq} have scientifically documented
  algorithms, but those are hard to understand and cannot get to work.
  \item[Probability:] Medium (as the author has no previous knowledge of
  implementations)
  \item[Impact:] High (as the project requirements cannot be fulfilled)
  \item[Magnitude:] High
  \item[Response Strategy:] Mitigate---It will be researched if there exists a
  library or projects who can be reused who implement the needed
  functionalities. If not, the own implementation will be tackled as soon as
  possible.
\end{description}

\section{Missing Knowledge}

\begin{description}
  \item[Description:] The author lacks knowledge to implement a feature which
  leads to delays in the project plan.
  \item[Probability:] Medium (as the author knows he knows nothing)
  \item[Impact:] Medium (as the project has a fixed time span)
  \item[Magnitude:] Medium
  \item[Response Strategy:] Mitigate---A time reserve of multiple days will be
  planned to reduce the impact of delays. Unsure or complicated looking tasks
  will be tackled early in the project. For tasks the author has little or no
  knowledge of, time to learn will be included in the project plan.
\end{description}

\section{A Browser Does Not Support a Required API}

\begin{description}
  \item[Description:] It is not possible to support a required browser (other
  than risk \ref{sec:riskedgedatachannels}, which spawned from this risk).
  \item[Probability:] Low (as the currently known APIs are supported)
  \item[Impact:] High (as the project requirements cannot be fulfilled)
  \item[Magnitude:] Medium
  \item[Response Strategy:] Mitigate---It will be researched as soon as possible
  for each requirement which APIs are needed and if the browser need it. If not,
  a workaround is researched.
\end{description}

\section{Missing Permission For Game Reference Implementation}

\begin{description}
  \item[Description:] The author does not get permission for reference
  implementations at multiple board game publishers.
  \item[Probability:] Low (as the author has connections to the board game
  industry)
  \item[Impact:] High (as the project requirements cannot be fulfilled)
  \item[Magnitude:] Medium
  \item[Response Strategy:] Mitigate---The permissions will be optained as soon
  as possible through using the personal connections to board game publishers.
\end{description}

\section{Impossible Cryptographic Requirement}

\begin{description}
  \item[Description:] The author finds no way to implement a cryptographic
  requirement such as \ref{itm:distributedrandomness} in section
  \see{sec:nonfunctionalreq}.
  \item[Probability:] Low (as the author researched the possibilities before
  writing the project proposal)
  \item[Impact:] High (as the project requirements cannot be fulfilled)
  \item[Magnitude:] Medium
  \item[Response Strategy:] Mitigate---Working algorithms for the cryptographic
  requirements will be researched and documented in this thesis as soon as
  possible.

% \subsection{Description}
% 
% Draw a Card from a Deck. The other clients will not know which card was drawn.
% It is not possible to draw the same card twice, neither on the same client, nor
% with different clients.
% 
% The Deck has to be created (see REFERENCE) and the game has to be started (see
% REFERENCE). A listener to the timeoutError event has to be registered to avoid
% silent fails.
% 
% If a card was successfull determined, the drawFinish event will be emited with
% the new Card object. If a network timeout to an other client occured, a
% timeoutError event will be emited with an Error object.
% 
% \subsection{Example}
% 
% \begin{lstlisting}
% deck.on.timeoutError.add(error => alert(error.message));
% deck.on.drawFinish.add(card => alert(card.id));
% deck.draw();
% \end{lstlisting}
